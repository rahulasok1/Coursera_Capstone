# Introduction/Business Problem 

Ajay is a successful restaurateur based in Mumbai, India. Under his brand AJ hospitality group, he has a chain of fine dining restaurants across India. He intends to expand his business and plans to start an Indian fine dining restaurant in Toronto, Canada in 2021. To begin with, AJ hospitality group approaches an analytics company in Toronto and assigns them with the task of conducting a market feasibility study. 

The objective for the company is to understand and analyse the neighbourhoods in Toronto suitable for AJ hospitality group to start their operations. They have to collect information on Indian population in different neighbourhoods in Toronto,  understand the different income groups and also understand the competitors in the area. Finally, they intend to segregate the neighbourhoods to different clusters based on similarities of factors mentioned above. This will help AJ hospitality group to make an intelligent decision by January 2021. 

## Target Audience

Such a study would be beneficial for anyone planning to setup a restaurant in Toronto. The analytics company can make use of this model for their other restaurant clients who are interested in understanding the ethnicity-competitor landscape before setting up their base in Toronto.
